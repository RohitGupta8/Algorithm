# Algorithm
1. Write static functions to return all permutations of a String using iterative method and
Recursion method. Check if the arrays returned by two string functions are equal.
2. Binary Search the Word from Word List
a. Desc -> Read in a list of words from File. Then prompt the user to enter a word to
search the list. The program reports if the search word is found in the list.
b. I/P -> read in the list words comma separated from a File and then enter the word
to be searched
c. Logic -> Use Arrays to sort the word list and then do the binary search
d. O/P -> Print the result if the word is found or not
3. Insertion Sort
a. Desc -> Reads in strings and prints them in sorted order using insertion sort.
b. I/P -> read in the list words
c. Logic -> Use Insertion Sort to sort the words in the String array
d. O/P -> Print the Sorted List
4. Bubble Sort
a. Desc -> Reads in integers prints them in sorted order using Bubble Sort
b. I/P -> read in the list ints
c. O/P -> Print the Sorted List
5. Merge Sort - Write a program to do Merge Sort of list of Strings.
a. Logic -> To Merge Sort an array, we divide it into two halves, sort the two halves
independently, and then merge the results to sort the full array. To sort a[lo, hi),
we use the following recursive strategy:
b. Base case: If the subarray length is 0 or 1, it is already sorted.
c. Reduction step: Otherwise, compute mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2, recursively sort the
two subarrays a[lo, mid) and a[mid, hi), and merge them to produce a sorted
result.
6. An Anagram Detection Example
a. Desc -> One string is an anagram of another if the second is simply a
rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams...
b. I/P -> Take 2 Strings as Input such abcd and dcba and Check for Anagrams
c. O/P -> The Two Strings are Anagram or not....

7. Take a range of 0 - 1000 Numbers and find the Prime numbers in that range.
8. Extend the above program to find the prime numbers that are Anagram and
Palindrome
